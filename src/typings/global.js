Unfortunately, the code you provided is TypeScript declaration files, which are used to provide type information for JavaScript libraries. They cannot be directly converted to JavaScript code, as they are not executable code themselves.

However, if you have a JavaScript code snippet that you'd like to convert to TypeScript or vice versa, feel free to provide it and I'll be happy to help!
